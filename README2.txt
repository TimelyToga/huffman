Impression:
This assignment really helped me understand a lot about the ins and outs of file compression.
The documentation was poorly structured, but riddled with excellent advice and information. Despite
the high complexity of this assignment, I never felt lost or without a clear path to solve the 
problems that have been given to Emre and I.
